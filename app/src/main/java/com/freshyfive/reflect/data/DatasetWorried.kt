When you create a structured schedule, you eliminate the uncertainty that often fuels worry. Start by setting specific times for studying, breaks, meals, and relaxation. Stick to this routine as closely as possible, allowing yourself flexibility when needed. A consistent routine provides a sense of control, making it easier to manage your time and responsibilities without feeling overwhelmed. Remember, a well-balanced routine includes time for self-care, hobbies, and social activities, all of which contribute to a calmer, more focused mind."

Start with a few minutes of mindfulness each day, paying attention to your breathing, body sensations, or surroundings. When your mind starts to wander, gently bring your focus back to the present. This practice helps you stay grounded and prevents your mind from getting caught up in 'what if' scenarios. Over time, regular mindfulness can help you develop a more peaceful and resilient mindset, making it easier to cope with worries and challenges."

Once your workday ends, make it a point to disconnect from work-related activities. Turn off email notifications and resist the urge to check in on work matters. This separation allows your mind to rest and recharge, making you more effective when you return to work. Establishing this boundary is crucial for managing stress and maintaining a healthy work-life balance."
